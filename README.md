# MiceProteinNeuralNetwork

Tests several machine learning models:
* Random forest.
* NeuralNetwork.
* KNN (K Nearest Neightboors).
* SVM (Support Vector Machine).

The dataset has mouses with several characteristics and the system will predict if the mouse with Down Syndrome have a successful learning result with one of the medicine combination.
